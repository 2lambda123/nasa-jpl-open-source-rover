# Main Body Assembly

## DOCUMENTATION IN PROGRESS

The body is the housing of all the electronics for the rover and acts as the attachment point for the differential pivot and the body axis that the rocker-bogies on either side connect to.

### Laser Cut Body Plates

The body plates that attach to all sides of the body are designed to be made from laser cut acrylic, MDF, hardwood, or similar. The 2D cutout files  are the .DXF files in the [laser cut parts folder](laser_cut_parts/dxf). They were designed to be around 3mm thick (1/8"). You can choose a material and cut them at your local makerspace's laser cutter or order them from an online service like [Sculpteo](https://www.sculpteo.com) or [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/).
