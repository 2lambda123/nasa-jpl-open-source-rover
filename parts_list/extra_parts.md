## Extra Parts

These parts you may either already have, depend on where you're located for a good deal, depend on personal preference, or are optional.

### A gamepad or remote controller

This is technically not a requirement, especially if you're planning on making the rover autonomous, but is highly recommended. Any USB based option should work here.

Some options are getting an XBox controller with a usb dongle or for longer range; the pricier [Spektrum WS2000](https://www.spektrumrc.com/product/ws2000-wireless-simulator-usb-dongle/SPMWS2000.html) with [Spektrum DXs](https://www.spektrumrc.com/product/dxs-transmitter-only/SPMR1010.html) transmitter. Many alternatives exist and will work ok.

## Standoff kit for the boards

You'll want these to mount the PCBs to the rover body. Many options exist here, for example [this kit](https://www.amazon.com/HELIFOUNER-Spacers-Standoffs-Assortment-Tweezers/dp/B0B25BKNKK/ref=sr_1_8?crid=368EQQU16L7YW&keywords=m2.5+spacer+standoff+kit&qid=1679272746&sprefix=m2.5+spacer+standoff+kit%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-8).

## Wiring

We recommend getting 18AWG and 20AWG wire.
